Map
===

A basic map implemented in an AVL tree.

NOTE: Keys are passed as void pointers and their data is not copied (this
should be handled by the user), they should not be freed without clearing the
map.

NOTE: There is currently no way to distinquish between a failed retrieval
(pop, index, back, etc.) and returning a NULL value. Keep this in mind if
you plan on storing NULL values in the vector, there are plans to fix this in
the future.

Types
----
The following types are defined in the header file:
[[map]]
+map+
~~~~~
This structure holds all internal information regarding a map.
All functions (except constructors) expect a pointer to this struct as their
first parameter.

[[cmp_func]]
+cmp_func+
~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a pointer to a function that to compare keys from pointers. This
typedef is provided to cast comparison functions as a map expects the
comparison function to take void* as its parameters.
